**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Project:** PetLog MVP
**Assessed By:** Endre
**Assessment Type:** Phase 3 to Phase 4 Transition Validation

---

## Executive Summary

{{readiness_assessment}}

---

## Project Context

**Project Name:** PetLog MVP
**Project Type:** Software
**Project Level:** 3 (Greenfield)
**Field Type:** Greenfield
**Workflow Path:** greenfield-level-3.yaml

**Assessment Scope:**
This readiness check validates the transition from Phase 3 (Solutioning) to Phase 4 (Implementation). For a Level 3 greenfield project, this includes comprehensive validation of:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Architecture Document
- Epic and Story Breakdown
- Cross-document alignment and completeness

**Current Workflow Status:**
- ✅ Product Brief: Completed
- ⚠️ PRD: Required (needs status update)
- ⚠️ Architecture: Required (needs status update)
- 🔄 Solutioning Gate Check: In Progress (current)
- ⏭️ Sprint Planning: Next workflow

**Validation Mode:** Comprehensive (Level 3 standard)

## Document Inventory

### Documents Reviewed

| Document Type | File Path | Size | Last Modified | Status |
|--------------|-----------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Product Requirements Document** | `docs/PRD.md` | 53KB | Nov 4, 2025 | ✅ Found |
| **Architecture Document** | `docs/architecture.md` | 62KB | Nov 5, 2025 | ✅ Found |
| **Epic & Story Breakdown** | `docs/epics.md` | 78KB | Nov 3, 2025 | ✅ Found |
| **UX Design Artifacts** | - | - | - | ⚪ Not Found (Conditional) |
| **Technical Specification** | - | - | - | ⚪ Not Required (Level 3 has separate architecture doc) |

**Document Completeness:** 3/3 required documents present (100%)

**Observations:**
- All core planning documents exist and are substantial in size
- Architecture document is the most recently updated (Nov 5, 2025)
- Epics document is the oldest but predates PRD updates
- No UX artifacts found (acceptable as UX workflow is conditional for Level 3)

### Document Analysis Summary

**PRD Analysis (docs/PRD.md - 53KB, 1176 lines):**

*Core Requirements Identified:*
- **8 Functional Requirement Sections:** FR-1 (User Account Management) through FR-8 (Subscription & Tier Management)
- **Success Criteria:** User-focused outcomes (100+ users, 20% premium conversion, 50%+ 30-day retention)
- **Business Model:** Freemium with specific limits (1 pet, 50 health records, 100 expenses/month, 10 reminders, 100MB storage)
- **Timeline:** 14-day MVP development target
- **Technology Stack:** React 18, Vite, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), Stripe, OneSignal, Resend, Vercel
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance (<2s page load), Security (GDPR, RLS), Scalability (10K+ users, <$0.10/user/month)

*Scope Boundaries:*
- MVP: 7 core features (auth, pets, health, expenses, reminders, documents, subscription)
- Explicitly excluded from MVP: Multi-user accounts, receipt OCR, medication tracking, vet portal integration, native mobile apps
- Post-MVP Phase 2/Vision features clearly documented

*Key Architectural Constraints from PRD:*
- Mobile-first responsive design (640px primary target)
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture - no SSR needed
- Row Level Security (RLS) mandatory for data isolation
- Free tier limits enforced backend-first (not just UI)
- Dual notification system (OneSignal push + Resend email for redundancy)

**Architecture Document Analysis (docs/architecture.md - 62KB, 2070 lines):**

*Technology Decisions (All Versions Verified Nov 2025):*
- React 19.2.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Vite (latest), Tailwind CSS 4.0, React Router 7.9.4
- Supabase (PostgreSQL 15/17), Stripe API 2025-10-29.clover, Playwright 1.56.1, Vitest 4.0
- Complete stack: 25+ technology decisions with rationale for each

*Implementation Patterns Defined:*
- 10 mandatory patterns for AI agent consistency
- Naming conventions (files, database, components, functions)
- Component structure pattern (exact order: imports → types → hooks → handlers → JSX)
- Database schema pattern (RLS policies, CASCADE DELETE, indexes)
- Supabase query pattern (always check error first)
- Form validation pattern (React Hook Form + Zod)
- State management pattern (React Context)
- Error handling pattern (consistent messages)
- Styling pattern (Tailwind class order, mobile-first)
- Date/time handling (UTC storage, local display)

*Database Schema:*
- 7 tables defined: profiles, pets, health_records, expenses, budgets, reminders, documents
- All tables have RLS policies with SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE rules
- Foreign keys with CASCADE DELETE
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

*Epic to Architecture Mapping:*
- Clear mapping of all 7 epics to architectural components

**Epics Document Analysis (docs/epics.md - 78KB, 1873 lines):**

*Story Breakdown:*
- **Total:** 7 epics, 69 stories
- Implementation phases across 8 weeks (14-day target mentioned in PRD may need adjustment)
- Each story includes: User story format, acceptance criteria (4-7 per story), technical notes, prerequisites
- Dependencies clearly mapped with parallel execution opportunities identified
