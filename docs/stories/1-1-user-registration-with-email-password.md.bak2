## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with Vite for fast development
- React Router v6 for client-side routing
- React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation
- shadcn/ui components (built on Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

**Backend:**
- Supabase BaaS (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Supabase Auth for user authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

**Key Libraries:**
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client
- `react-hook-form` - Form state management
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `@hookform/resolvers` - React Hook Form + Zod integration

### Architecture Patterns

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User submits signup form
2. Frontend validates with Zod schema (real-time feedback)
3. Call Supabase `auth.signUp()` with email and password
4. Supabase creates user in auth.users table
5. Frontend creates corresponding profile in profiles table
6. Redirect user to email verification prompt page
7. User clicks verification link in email (handled by Supabase)

**Context API for Auth State:**
- AuthContext provides global authentication state
- Wraps entire app in provider
- Components use useAuth() hook to access auth methods and user state
- Listens to Supabase auth state changes via onAuthStateChange

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- profiles table (complementary to auth.users)
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'free' CHECK (subscription_tier IN ('free', 'premium'))
);

-- RLS policies
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Expected File Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── auth/
│       ├── SignupForm.tsx        # Main signup form component
│       └── AuthLayout.tsx        # Layout wrapper for auth pages
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.tsx           # Global auth state management
├── lib/
│   └── supabase.ts               # Supabase client initialization
├── pages/
│   └── SignupPage.tsx            # Signup route page
├── schemas/
│   └── auth.ts                   # Zod validation schemas
└── App.tsx                       # Root component with router
```

**shadcn/ui Components Needed:**
- Form components (Input, Label, Button)
- Card component for auth layout
- Toast/Alert for error messages

### Validation Rules

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least 1 number (0-9)
- Confirm password must match password

**Zod Schema Example:**
```typescript
const signupSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters")
    .regex(/[A-Z]/, "Password must contain at least 1 uppercase letter")
    .regex(/[0-9]/, "Password must contain at least 1 number"),
  confirmPassword: z.string()
}).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"]
});
```

### Error Handling

**Duplicate Email:**
- Supabase returns error when email already exists
- Catch error and display user-friendly message: "An account with this email already exists"
- Provide link to login page

**Network Errors:**
- Show toast notification: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection"
- Provide retry button

**Validation Errors:**
- Display inline below each field (real-time as user types)
- Prevent form submission until all validations pass

### Performance Considerations

- Form validation is client-side (fast feedback)
- Loading spinner during API call (perceived performance)
- Optimistic UI: Assume success and handle errors gracefully
- Target: Form submission completes in <60 seconds (per PRD)

### Security Notes

- Passwords never stored in plain text (Supabase handles hashing)
- HTTPS-only communication (enforced by Vercel)
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints (Supabase built-in: 60 req/min per IP)

### Testing Strategy

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Successful signup with valid credentials
- [ ] Duplicate email rejection
- [ ] Password validation (too short, missing uppercase, missing number)
- [ ] Confirm password mismatch
- [ ] Real-time validation feedback
- [ ] Email format validation
- [ ] Empty field validation
- [ ] Loading state during submission
- [ ] Redirect to verification prompt
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile (minimum 640px width)

### Dependencies

**Prerequisite Stories:**
- None - This is the foundational story for Epic 1

**Blocks Stories:**
- Story 1.2: Email Verification Flow (requires signup to exist)
- Story 1.3: User Login (requires signup to create users)
- All subsequent stories (authentication is foundational)

### Implementation Notes

**First-Time Setup:**
1. Initialize Vite + React project (if not already done)
2. Install dependencies: Supabase client, React Hook Form, Zod, shadcn/ui
3. Set up Supabase project and obtain API keys
4. Configure environment variables
5. Create profiles table in Supabase

**Development Approach:**
- Start with Supabase setup (database and client)
- Build AuthContext for state management
- Create validation schema
- Build UI components (form and layout)
- Integrate API calls
- Test thoroughly with various inputs

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't forget to create profile entry after auth.signUp()
- Handle async errors properly (try-catch blocks)
- Ensure RLS policies are enabled (or signup will fail)
- Test with email verification disabled in Supabase settings initially (for faster dev)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Endre
**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Review Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Outcome

**CHANGES REQUESTED** ⚠️

The implementation is **functionally complete** and successfully implements all 6 acceptance criteria. However, there are 2 MEDIUM severity issues that should be addressed before merging to production:

1. **Profile creation error handling** - Silent failure could lead to orphaned auth users
2. **Password strength** - Current requirements are functional but could be stronger (advisory)
3. **No automated tests** - Acceptable for MVP but limits regression detection

All core functionality works as specified. The issues identified are quality improvements that will make the system more robust and maintainable.

### Summary

This is a **solid first implementation** of the authentication foundation. The code is well-structured, uses modern React patterns, and properly separates concerns. The developer has successfully:

✅ Built a complete signup flow with email/password authentication
✅ Implemented real-time form validation with excellent UX
✅ Created comprehensive database schema with proper RLS policies
✅ Established global auth state management via Context API
✅ Used TypeScript + Zod for type safety and runtime validation
✅ Created responsive, accessible UI with shadcn/ui components

The main areas for improvement are **error resilience** (handling profile creation failures) and **testing coverage** (no automated tests). The security posture is generally good with proper use of Supabase Auth, RLS policies, and React's XSS protection.

### Key Findings

#### HIGH Severity Issues
*None identified* ✅

#### MEDIUM Severity Issues

1. **[MEDIUM] Profile Creation Error Handling Insufficient**
   - **File:** src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:68-71
   - **Issue:** Profile creation errors are silently logged but not handled. This could result in auth users without corresponding profiles, breaking the data model.
   - **Impact:** Users could successfully sign up in Supabase Auth but fail to create a profile, leading to orphaned auth records, app errors when trying to access profile data, and poor user experience.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement one of these strategies: (A) Rollback - Delete the auth user if profile creation fails, (B) Retry with exponential backoff, or (C) Defer - Create profile on first login if missing
   - **Severity Rationale:** MEDIUM because it affects data integrity but is unlikely in normal operation (transient database failures)

2. **[MEDIUM] Password Requirements Could Be Stronger**
   - **File:** src/schemas/auth.ts:7-11
   - **Issue:** Current validation enforces 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number. Industry best practice (NIST) recommends either 12+ characters OR including special characters.
   - **Recommendation:** Consider increasing to 12 chars min, adding special character requirement, or adding lowercase letter requirement (currently missing)
   - **Impact:** Weaker passwords are more susceptible to brute force attacks
   - **Severity Rationale:** MEDIUM because Supabase provides rate limiting (60 req/min) which mitigates brute force attacks, and current requirements are functional for MVP
   - **Note:** This is more of an advisory improvement than a blocking issue

#### LOW Severity Issues

3. **[LOW] Missing Specific Error Types in Form Handler**
   - **File:** src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:38-39
   - **Issue:** Generic error handling doesn't distinguish between network errors, Supabase errors, and validation errors
   - **Recommendation:** Implement specific error handling for common scenarios (network failures, Supabase timeouts, etc.) to provide better user guidance

4. **[LOW] Hard-Coded Placeholder Links in Footer**
   - **File:** src/components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx:31-41
   - **Issue:** Footer links point to "#" placeholders
   - **Recommendation:** Either implement actual Terms/Privacy pages or remove the footer until ready

5. **[LOW] No Client-Side Rate Limit Handling**
   - **Issue:** Relies entirely on Supabase built-in rate limiting (60 req/min per IP) without client-side feedback
   - **Recommendation:** Catch rate limit errors and show user-friendly message: "Too many attempts. Please try again in a few minutes"

6. **[LOW] Email Verification Not Enforced**
   - **Issue:** Users can sign up successfully without email verification. This is intentional (Story 1.2 will enforce it) but noted for completeness.
   - **Status:** Expected behavior per epic planning - Story 1.2 will add verification enforcement

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

**Summary:** ✅ **6 of 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented**

| AC# | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC1 | Signup form displays email, password, confirm password, and name fields | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:48-108 |
| AC2 | Password validation enforces: minimum 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 number | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/schemas/auth.ts:7-11 |
| AC3 | Duplicate email addresses rejected with clear error message | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:76-78, SignupForm.tsx:113-119 |
| AC4 | Successful registration creates user in Supabase Auth and profiles table | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:44-66, migrations/001_create_profiles_table.sql |
| AC5 | User redirected to email verification prompt after signup | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:36, VerifyEmailPage.tsx:1-38 |
| AC6 | Form validation provides real-time feedback | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:25 (mode: 'onChange') |

**AC Coverage Analysis:**
- All acceptance criteria have been implemented with verified code evidence
- Real-time validation (AC6) is properly configured with React Hook Form's `onChange` mode
- Error handling (AC3) includes both backend error catching and frontend UX
- Database schema (AC4) includes proper foreign key constraints and RLS policies
- UI components (AC1) use accessible shadcn/ui components with proper ARIA attributes

### Task Completion Validation

**Summary:** ✅ **9 of 10 tasks verified complete**, ⚠️ **1 task questionable** (Testing - manual only)

| Task | Marked As | Verified As | Evidence |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Task 1: Set up Supabase project | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/lib/supabase.ts:1-12, package.json:15 |
| Task 2: Create profiles table with RLS | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | supabase/migrations/001_create_profiles_table.sql |
| Task 3: Create authentication context | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:1-117 |
| Task 4: Create Zod validation schema | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/schemas/auth.ts:3-17 |
| Task 5: Build SignupForm component | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:1-143 |
| Task 6: Implement signup logic | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:44-66, SignupForm.tsx:36 |
| Task 7: Create AuthLayout component | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/components/auth/AuthLayout.tsx:1-47 |
| Task 8: Create signup page and routing | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/pages/SignupPage.tsx, src/App.tsx:10-14 |
| Task 9: Add error handling | ✅ Complete | ✅ VERIFIED | src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:110-131 |
| Task 10: Testing and validation | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE | Manual testing only. No automated tests found. Acceptable for MVP. |

**Task Validation Notes:**
- **Task 10 Status:** While marked complete, testing is manual only. The story context states "Manual testing is the primary approach for MVP," so this is **acceptable per requirements** but represents technical debt.
- **No False Completions:** All other tasks marked complete have been verified with code evidence. Excellent adherence to task completion accuracy.
- **Code Quality:** Implementation quality is high - clean structure, proper TypeScript usage, good separation of concerns.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current State:** ❌ No automated tests
**Manual Testing:** ✅ Comprehensive checklist provided in story

**Test Gaps:**
1. **Unit Tests Missing:** Zod schema validation, AuthContext methods, form submission logic, error handling paths
2. **Integration Tests Missing:** Full signup flow, duplicate email rejection, network error handling, RLS policy enforcement
3. **E2E Tests Missing:** Complete user journey, responsive design validation, accessibility validation

**Recommendation:** Set up Vitest + React Testing Library for future stories. For MVP, manual testing is acceptable per PRD, but automated tests should be added before production launch.

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Excellent alignment with Epic 1 technical specifications**

**Confirmed Architectural Patterns:**
- ✅ React 18 + Vite build system
- ✅ Supabase BaaS for auth and database
- ✅ React Hook Form + Zod validation
- ✅ shadcn/ui components with Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Context API for auth state
- ✅ React Router v6 for routing
- ✅ Row Level Security policies

**Database Schema Compliance:**
- ✅ profiles table structure matches spec
- ✅ Foreign key constraint to auth.users with CASCADE delete
- ✅ Default subscription_tier='free'
- ✅ RLS policies correctly use auth.uid() for user isolation

**File Structure Compliance:**
- ✅ Matches expected structure from story Dev Notes
- ✅ Proper separation: components/, contexts/, lib/, pages/, schemas/
- ✅ TypeScript configuration present

**No Architecture Violations Detected** ✅

### Security Notes

**Overall Security Posture:** ✅ Good for MVP with noted improvements

**Security Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Password Security:** Supabase handles hashing (bcrypt) - passwords never stored in plain text
2. ✅ **SQL Injection Protection:** Using Supabase client with parameterized queries
3. ✅ **XSS Protection:** React's built-in escaping, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
4. ✅ **RLS Policies:** Properly configured with auth.uid() checks prevent unauthorized data access
5. ✅ **HTTPS Enforcement:** Vercel deployment (HTTPS-only)
6. ✅ **CSRF Protection:** SameSite cookies (Supabase default)
7. ✅ **Rate Limiting:** Supabase built-in (60 req/min per IP)

**Security Findings:** See MEDIUM severity finding #2 (password strength) and LOW severity finding #5 (rate limit handling)

**Security Best Practices Observed:**
- Environment variable validation
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zod for runtime validation (defense in depth)
- Proper error messages (no sensitive data leakage)
- Loading states prevent double submission

### Action Items

#### Code Changes Required:

- [ ] [High] Implement profile creation failure handling (AC #4) [file: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:68-71]
  - **Options:** (A) Rollback auth user on profile failure, (B) Retry with backoff, or (C) Create profile on first login
  - **Recommended:** Option A (rollback) for data consistency

- [ ] [Med] Consider strengthening password requirements (AC #2) [file: src/schemas/auth.ts:7-11]
  - **Current:** 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
  - **Recommendation:** Add either (A) increase to 12 chars min, (B) add special character requirement, or (C) add lowercase requirement
  - **Note:** Current requirements are functional for MVP; this is a quality improvement

- [ ] [Low] Add specific error handling for network failures (AC #3, #6) [file: src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:38-39]
  - Distinguish between network errors, Supabase service errors, and auth errors for better user guidance

- [ ] [Low] Implement client-side rate limit error handling (AC #3) [file: src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx or SignupForm.tsx]
  - Catch rate limit errors (429 status) and show user-friendly message

#### Advisory Notes:

- Note: Email verification enforcement is intentionally not implemented (Story 1.2 dependency) ✅
- Note: Automated tests missing but acceptable per MVP manual testing strategy. Consider adding Vitest + RTL for future stories
- Note: Footer placeholder links (Terms, Privacy, Contact) should be implemented or removed before production launch
- Note: Consider adding .env.example file to repository for developer onboarding
- Note: Consider adding error logging/monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) for production error tracking
